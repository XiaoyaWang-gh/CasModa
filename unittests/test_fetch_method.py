Based on the compilation error you provided, it seems that the method `stripBoundaryQuotes()` is not found in the `ArgumentTest8` class. To fix this error, you need to update the test case to use the correct method from the `ArgumentImpl` class.

Here's an updated test case that should pass the test:

```java
public void testStripBoundaryQuotes() {
    final ArgumentImpl arg = new ArgumentImpl("name", "description", 0, 1, '\0', '\0', null, null, null, 1);
    final String token = "\"quoted string\"";
    assertEquals("quoted string", arg.stripBoundaryQuotes(token));
}
```

Please note that I've replaced `stripBoundaryQuotes(token)` with `arg.stripBoundaryQuotes(token)` to ensure the method is called correctly from the `arg` object. Make sure to update your test case accordingly and try running it again
